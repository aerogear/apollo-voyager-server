# Apollo Voyager Server Examples

The `examples` directory has example applications that show how the Voyager framework can be used.

If you have run the `npm run bootstrap` command, the dependencies should already be installed.

## Basic Example

`basic/server.js` is the simplest example of how to use the `apollo-voyager-server` framework.

```
$ node examples/basic/server.js
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and you will see the GraphQL Playground. This is a space where you can try out queries and see the results.

Try the following query.

```
query hello {
  hello
}
```

## Keycloak Example

`keycloak/server.js` shows how we can use the `KeycloakSecurityService` from `apollo-voyager-keycloak` to protect our app with Keycloak.

This example shows 

* How to set up authentication on the `/graphql` endpoint
* How to add role based access control on a Schema level using the `@hasRole` directive.

### Keycloak Setup

This example requires some extra setup. A `docker-compose.yml` file has been included to simplify a local keycloak setup.

The following steps set up a local keycloak instance, configures the instance for an example application and sets up a user that we can log into the application.

```
cd examples/keycloak/config
docker-compose up
```

* Open [http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/](http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/) and login with the user `admin` and password `admin`.
* Click **Add Realm** and click **Select File** next to the **Import** label.
* Select the [examples/keycloak/config/realm-export.json](examples/keycloak/config/realm-export.json) file and click **Create**.
* Click **Users** and add a new user called `developer`. You can choose your own name if you wish.
* Under the **Credentials** tab add a new password of **developer** and make sure it is not temporary. You can choose your own password if you wish.
* Under the **Role Mappings** tab assign the **admin** realm role.
* Select the **voyager-testing** option from the **Client Roles** dropdown and assign the **admin** role.

### Start the Server

```
node examples/keycloak/server.js
Initializing Keycloak authentication
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and you will be redirected to a login page. Log in with the user that was created earlier you should now see the the GraphQL playground.

In the playground you will see an error.

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch schema. Please check your connection"
}
```

Do not worry, this error is caused by the playground making unauthenticated requests. One more step is needed.

In a new tab, open [http://localhost:4000/token](http://localhost:4000/token). You should see a JSON result.

```json
{"Authorization":"Bearer <Long String of Characters>"}
```

Copy the entire JSON result to your clipboard and navigate back to the Playground at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql). 

In the Playground, click the **HTTP Headers** button and paste the JSON result into the input box. If successful, the error will disappear and it is now possible to make queries.

Try out the following query

```
query hello {
  hello
}
```

### Role Based Access Control

The query above will only work if the authenticated user has the `admin` role. You can see this rule being applied with the `@hasRole(role: "admin")` directive in [examples/keycloak/server.js](examples/keycloak/server.js#L22).

Try change the the role to a made up role and restart the server. Try the sample query again and verify that an error is displayed.
