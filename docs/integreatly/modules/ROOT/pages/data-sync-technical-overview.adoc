|Component|Technical Role
|Sync Client| The Sync client is a client side JavaScript library used for building web and mobile applications. It allows for simple Sync server integration.
|Sync Server| The Sync server is based on the Apollo Server framework and it performs two primary functions. It sends and retrieves data from a data source, and it syncs data across the Sync clients. The Sync server uses GraphQL to create custom connections that in turn allow various types of Sync clients to connect.
|Data sources| The data source stores data. This data is typically what is synchronized across the Sync clients.
