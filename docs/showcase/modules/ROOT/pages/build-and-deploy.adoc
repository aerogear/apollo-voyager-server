== Building and Running the Showcase App

. Build the Mobile App

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ npm install
$ npm run ionic:build
----

[start=2]
. Run the Mobile App

To run the showcase app, use these commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ npm run ionic:android # to run on an Android device or emulator
$ npm run ionic:ios # to run on an iOS device or emulator
----

These commands would run the app on a device if connected or on the emulator if no device is connected.

Alternatively, you can use Cordova commands directly to specify the target:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ ionic cordova run android --device      # run on a connected device
$ ionic cordova run android --emulator    # run on the Android emulator
----
