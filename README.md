# Apollo Voyager Server

Home of the Aerogear Data Sync Framework. The goal of this project is to make it easier to build secure, production ready, realtime APIs and applications with GraphQL. 

The project does this by taking the popular [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) framework and adding additional components to solve some common problems.

* Realtime Synchronisation
* Conflict Resolution
* Authentication and Authorization

**Warning:** This project is under heavy development and is not recommended for production usage.
